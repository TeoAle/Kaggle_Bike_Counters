# Kaggle Bike Counters Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Kaggle Bike Counters Project repository! This project is part of the MDSB 2023 Kaggle Challenge, focusing on predicting bike traffic in Paris. It combines data analysis, machine learning, and a passion for urban mobility to provide insights into the bustling bike lanes of Paris.

## Project Description
In the "Kaggle Bike Counters" project, we tackled the MDSB 2023 Kaggle Challenge, focusing on predicting bike traffic in Paris. Utilizing data from various bike counters across the city, we aimed to predict the number of bikes per hour, incorporating a range of methodologies and models in our pursuit.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used, including bike counter data and external environmental factors.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing our data exploration, analysis, and modeling.
- `python_files/`: Implementation of the machine learning model tested and refined for the project.
